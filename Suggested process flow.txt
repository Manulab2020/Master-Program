1. Movicon
- User chooses product (product ID, INT)
- User inserts name (username, STRING)
- User presses order button (order confirmed, BOOL)
- Variables shared with Sysmac are updated, and thus transmitted
- Movicon starts Python script (needs some delay to account for Sysmac processing time)


2. Sysmac initial processing
- Sysmac receives variables
  - If program is ongoing, add to queue
- Order confirmed being set to TRUE starts the program, set Order confirmed to FALSE
- Product ID determines what part of the program is run (one per product)
- Sysmac checks current Kanban storage
  - If the needed parts exist, send LD robot to pick them up and order new print
  - If they don't, order new print and wait for completion, then do as above. 
- Sysmac runs code that updates the info.csv for AddTextToDxf with username
- Send LD robot to manually use laser cutter and pick up objects


LD robot, laser cutter
- Once Dxt has been created, and Sysmac assigns a laser cutter job, send Taklo there. 
- Use vision to find control panel and start the laser cutter process
- Wait, and use vision to see when laser cutting process finishes, then pick up and either...
  - Carry plate to post-processing table for extraction
  - Put plate on Finnson or Ringstad and have them deliver to the table

LD robot, 3D printer, kanban
- Taklo drives to kanban storage
- Vision to find parts to pick up.
