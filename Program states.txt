X = Current main task
Y = Current hardware being used
Z = Current sub-task for hardware

Hardware list for Y:
Y=0: Setup
Y=1: Cutter
Y=2: Printer
Y=3: LD robot
Y=4: TM robot

------------------------------------------------------

0000 - Initial setup
	0000 - Set initial variables and initialize function blocks where necessary. Run background tasks once.
	0100 - Confirm that there is no error with cutter
	0200 - Confirm that there is at least 1 available/connected printer
	0300 - Connect to LD robots and confirm they work
	0400 - Connect to TM robots and confirm they work
	0500 - 
	0600 - 
	etc for viper, quattro

1000 - Idle
 - Wait for customer order
 - When one is received, copy it to orderCurrent and clear the original customerOrder, then move to state 2000
 - If no order is being processed at the moment and there is an order waiting in queue spot 1, copy it to orderCurrent and move to state 2000

Independent of master state:
- If a new order is received while another is processing, add order to the end of the queue array

2000 - Process order
	2000 - Initial setup, if required
	2100 - Processing for cutting 
	 - Use product ID to determine what pre-made dxf information should be used for cutting
	 - Add name to use on the plate/keychain
	2200 - Processing for printing
	 - Use product ID to check if there is at least one of the needed parts in storage
	 - Use printerPartsInStore for true or false.

3000 - Assign work tasks
	3000 - Initial setup, set variables for later use
	3100 - Assign cutter tasks
	 - Start program to csv dxf converter, then tell Movicon to run the dxf script function
	3200 - Assign printer tasks
		3200 - Iterate over printer array to find the first available printer, if there are any. 
		3210 - Write information to printer command struct
		3220 - Write printer command struct to csv, then tell Movicon to start the printer script
	3300 - Assign LD robot tasks
	 - If there are parts in store, send Taklo and either Finnson or Ringstad to put up parts 

4000 - Wait and follow production
	4000 - Setup
	4100 - Wait until cutterStatus says the cutting is done
	4200 - Printer tasks
	 - If printed parts are in storage, reduce current part number by 1 once LD has retrieved it
	 - If printed parts are not in storage, ____
	4300 - LD tasks

5000 - Assembly and delivery

6000 - Post-production cleanup
 - Clear out variables that need to be empty for the next order. 
 - If order was started from a queue, then move all spots in the queue down one, so the previous queue spot 2 is now 1, 3 is now 2, etc and clear the last position in the queue. 

9000 - Errors
- Divide master state it originated from by 10 and add 9 to front. Do error handling of them here.

10000 - state is set here when you don't want to run and loop the main program

BACKGROUND CODE
Code that always runs in the background, infinitely looping at a lower cycle time

- Update status for cutter and printer
- Confirm that buffer size is within reasonable bounds. If not, force it up to 0 or down to 20.
- Check printer status array if there are any finished prints. If yes, carry the print to kanban and add to current number of prints in store. 
- Check current buffer. If current parts in storage is smaller than buffer, then order new prints and add update the list of what printers are printing something and how many brackets/frames are being printed.
- Send all updated statuses to movicon.
