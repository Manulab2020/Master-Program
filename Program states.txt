X = Current main task

Z = Current sub-task for hardware

Hardware list for Y:
Y=0: Setup
Y=1: Cutter
Y=2: Printer
Y=3: LD robot
Y=4: TM robot

------------------------------------------------------

0000 - Initial setup
	0000 - Set initial variables and initialize function blocks where necessary. Run background tasks once.
	0100 - Confirm that there is no error with cutter
	0200 - Confirm that there is at least 1 available/connected printer
	0300 - Connect to LD robots and confirm they work
	0400 - Connect to TM robots and confirm they work
	0500 - 
	0600 - 
	etc for viper, quattro

1000 - Idle
 - Wait for customer order
 - When one is received, copy it to orderCurrent and clear the original customerOrder, then move to state 2000
 - If no order is being processed at the moment and there is an order waiting in queue spot 1, copy it to orderCurrent and move to state 2000

Independent of master state:
- If a new order is received while master state is not 1000, add order to the end of the queue array

2000 - Process order
	2000 - Initial setup, if required
	2100 - Processing for cutting 
	 - Use product ID to determine what pre-made dxf information should be used for cutting
	 - Add name to use on the plate/keychain
	2200 - Processing for printing
	 - Use product ID to check if there is at least one of the needed parts in storage
	 - Use printerPartsInStore for true or false.

3000 - Assign work tasks
	3000 - Initial setup, set variables for later use
	3100 - Assign cutter tasks
	 - Start program to csv to dxf converter, then tell Movicon to run the dxf script function
	3200 - Assign printer tasks
		3200 - Iterate over printer array to find the first available printer, if there are any. 
		3210 - Write information to printer command struct, telling it to print a new part of the product ID regardless of current inventory
		3220 - Write printer command struct to csv, then tell Movicon to start the printer script
	3300 - Assign LD robot tasks
	 - If there are parts in store, send Taklo and either Finnson or Ringstad to pick up printed parts from kanban. If not, wait until one has been printed. 

4000 - Wait and follow production
	4000 - Setup, wait until part has been picked up from kanban
	4100 - Wait until cutterStatus says the cutting is done
	4200 - No more actions needed for printer
	4300 - Pick up acrylic piece from laser cutter and bring to assembly

5000 - Assembly and delivery
	5000 - Start assembly
	5100 - Assembly complete, reset variables
	5200 - Pick up product and move to delivery location

6000 - Post-production cleanup
 - Clear out variables that need to be empty for the next order. 
 - If order was started from a queue, then move all spots in the queue down one, so the previous queue spot 2 is now 1, 3 is now 2, etc and clear the last position in the queue. 

9000 - Errors
- Perform error handling. Divide master state it originated from by 10 and add 9 to front to get error state.

BACKGROUND CODE
Code that always runs in the background, infinitely looping at a lower cycle time

- Update status for cutter
- Update status for printers
- Update list for current prints in progress
- Confirm that buffer size is within reasonable bounds. If not, force it up to 0 or down to 20.
- Check that the printers' bed temperature or nozzle temperature hasn't gotten too high, force shutdown if yes. Safety measure against hardware damage. 
- Check printer status array if there are any finished prints. If yes, carry the print to kanban and update current values for parts in store and current prints
- Check current buffer. If current parts in storage is smaller than buffer, then order new prints and add update the list of what printers are printing something and how many brackets/frames are being printed.
- Send all updated statuses to movicon.
